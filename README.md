Web-Audio-Visualizer
====================

This is a project I will be working on over the course of however long I decide this project lasts. 

Basically, you can drag and drop and audio file your browser can decode (There are some upper bounds for sizes, unforunately)
and my site will turn your song into a visualization using Three.js and the Web Audio API. 

Right now its in pretty primitive stages while I learn Three.js, but for the time being, songs can be decoded and the visualizer
depicts with colored spheres. 

<h1> Plans </h1>
After learning some Three.js, I hope to make this site very customizable; that is, the user will be able to customize what
the visualizer output will look like (to a certain extent) and it will be very manipulable. I'm not sure how long it will
take me to figure out how to do what I want, but I hope it will be very soon.
